<hr />

This is a Go implementation of my [PixEnc](https://github.com/fardinkamal62/PixEnc) project, which was originally written in Python.

I made this project to learn Go and I tried a different approach of encrypting image pixels.

I am not a Go developer. So, if you find any issue, please create an issue or pull request.

# Build
- Clone the repository
- Run `go build` to build & generate an executable file
- Run `go run .` to run the program

# Usage
- Download the appropriate latest release from GitHub Releases
- Run the executable file

### Encrypting Image
1. Keep the image you want to encrypt in the same directory as the executable file
2. Rename the image to `image.png`(if PNG) or `image.jpg`(if JPG)
3. Run the executable file
4. In choice menu, select `e` to encrypt image
5. Enter the password you want to use to encrypt the image
6. It will generate a file named `encrypt.png`

### Decrypting Image
1. Keep the image you want to decrypt in the same directory as the executable file | If you have encrypted the image using this program, then you can skip this step
2. Run the executable file
3. In choice menu, select `d` to decrypt image
4. Enter the password you used to encrypt the image
5. It will generate a file named `decrypt.png`


# Release Note
### 1.0.0 (Current)
- Can encrypt & decrypt images

# Planned Features
- Multi-threading
- File explorer
